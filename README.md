# Telephone-Dir-System

This Telephone Directory System includes a multitude of features, such as adding, listing, searching, modifying, and deleting telephone directory-related records. All these operations are done through file handling. All the added and modified data are recorded in a file, and the deleted information is removed from the file.

The directory stores the name, phone number, and address of the person whose record is entered in the telephone directory system project in C++. So, the simple file handling cum telephone directory operations users can perform in this program are:

1. Creation of Records
2. Showing Records
3. Modifying Records
4. Sorting Records
5. Searching Records
6. Deleting Records
